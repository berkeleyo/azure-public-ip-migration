# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this tool!

1. Open an issue describing your change or scenario.  
2. Fork → feature branch → pull request.  
3. Include validation or test output where practical and update docs.

**Commit style:** follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).  
**Safety:** always support `-WhatIf` for dry-runs, avoid destructive defaults.
